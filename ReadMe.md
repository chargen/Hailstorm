# Hailstorm Engine
Hailstorm Engine is a demonstration of DirctX and Windows graphical techniques, and a learning
environment to practice writing better, more testable, more reusable code. Perhaps some day it'll
grow up to be a real game! For the moment it's just graphical demos.

## What can it be used for?
Showing off shiny graphical demos.

## Give me a demonstration!
You're right, I should probably put a screenshot or movie link in here.

## Status
Deep in perpetual development! It's nowhere close to even alpha quality (alpha meaning some
semblence of a playable prototype). That said however, I try to keep the master branch at a high
enough quality level that people can always download the project, build it for themselves and
take it for a spin.

To see a list of big featuers, check out the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

I'm working on getting a CI server set up.

## Requirements (for building)
 * Windows 8.1
 * Visual Studio 2013 or newer
 * Windows Platform SDK -or- DirectX June 2013 SDK installed

## Building the source
### Visual Studio
After cloning the repository, open up Hailstorm.sln in Visual Studio

### Windows command line
After cloning the repository, run 'build.cmd'.

## How to get this running or how to use it
Detailed instructions on how to install, configure, and get the project running.
This should be frequently tested to ensure reliability. Alternatively, a link to
another page is fine, but it's important that this works.

## Getting involved
Thanks for wanting to help out! At the moment, there's not a whole lot of work needed for adding
new features, but if you spot any bugs or have some ideas feel free to contribute. I'd be super
happy if this project helps you on your own projects, so make sure to borrow anything you need
(with proper attribution!).

General instructions on _how_ to contribute can be found right here: [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Questions?
I'll set up an IRC channel or other way to get in touch with me soon. Until then you can use
the project tracker to talk with me.
