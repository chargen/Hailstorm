There are two great ways to help: 
 - Using the issue tracker to file bugs and feature requests
 - Submitting pull requests

## Using the issue tracker
The issue tracker to suggest ideas for new features, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well as others who are
interested in this solution.  

If you are looking for ideas on what to contribute, use the issue tracker! Find a bug or feature
that interests you, update the issue with a comment outlining what you plan on doing, and then
follow the advice below in _Changing the code-base_. 

## Changing the code base
Typically you should fork this repository, make changes in your own fork and then submit a pull
request. Please make sure all new code that is submitted has sufficient code coverage with new
unit tests, and the decent effort not to introduce new defects. Additionally we request that you
follow the coding guidelines for this project within reason. In the absence of such guidelines,
please mimic the styles and patterns in the existing code base.

Please follow these guidelines, otherwise your valuable contribution may be initially rejected until
it is in compliance. (The rules are forgiving and sane, I promise!) Ask a developer on the project
when in doubt!
